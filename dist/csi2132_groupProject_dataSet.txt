Portions are generous — no need for a starter — and there was nothing restrained about the pork tacos I was encouraged to order.

These daily creations have earned a loyal following, according to our server (both knowledgeable and helpful), and upon chomping down, one can understand why. On house-made corn tortillas, the filling is boldly flavoured, the presentation bright and cheery for a drab January day, and further surprises are tucked into the fat packages by way of textural contrasts. Chopped green apple is a nice one. So is the base layer of puréed squash perked with cumin. Thinly sliced radish lends peppery notes, slivers of sautéed red cabbage are bright pink grins; diced mango adds some sweetness, while red onion cuts it. The jerked pork itself is highly perfumed with cloves and allspice. On the plate are two of these taco treats and just in case these aren’t enough, gaps have been filled in with a cumin scented black bean salsa — the beans perfectly al dente, clearly not from a can — and a pile of dressed greens.

Fraser Café churns their own ice cream. Seen here: a scoop of pear and a scoop of walnut (Photo: Anne DesBrisay)

What did I have? Fraser fettuccine (freshly made) filled in with cherry tomatoes, roasted cauliflower, roasted garlic, toasted walnuts, and fresh sage, all paddling in a creamy garlic sauce with lots of nice chive snips and a tumbled mound of parmesan shards. Micro greens were the toupé on the top. And then, to get rid of the garlic, ice cream. Fraser churns its own, so pretty tough to say no to that. Walnut was one scoop, pear the other, good on their own, great together.

This was a good sign I thought. As a surprise, my husband reserved a table and when I stepped through the door I was delighted and eager to order. The dishes sounded wonderful. There were red and white checked tablecloths, soft slow jazz playing and we were seated right away. Our water glasses were filled instantaneously and we were promptly asked if we wanted wine or other drinks.
Our waitress was prompt and seemed pleasant. She said, in reply to my query, that the only home made pasta was the stuffed kind. I was slightly disappointed but not terribly so. Our bread arrived shortly after we ordered. We were given exactly two white tasteless soft - not Italian - stale rolls which werent worth the calories. Our waitress was also serving a table of four beside us. They were served a basket of assorted rolls and it was replenished. Ours was not - the tiny two roll basket was whisked away without even so much as a look at us. We were not offered more, but really didnt want more of the same anyway. Our water glasses were replenished by a young, cheerful bus-girl.
Then the food arrived - fairly quickly I thought - which was good since my husband hadnt eaten in over seven hours and was hungry. He had Fettuccine with Alfredo sauce. I had Penne Caruso with sausage and chopped sweet green and red.bell peppers. His meal looked lovely; mine did not. His was bland; mine was awful. The sauce was sweet and tasted canned, although it was supposed to have been home made - maybe it was, but it didnt taste like any home made sauce Id ever had in any Italian community or private home. If youve ever had Chef Boyardee, youll know exactly what it tasted like. The sausage was flavourless and the texture was gritty and spongy at the same time - and there was a lot of it, which wasnt a plus. Pizza pepperoni tastes better.
After our meal arrived our waitress asked us if the food was OK. My husband mumbled something and I looked at the
tablecloth. We didnt want to return it and create a scene. Besides, there wasnt anything particularly wrong with it, it just didnt taste very good. We should probably have said something - but even if we had, the experience was spoiled. He ate his but did not enjoy it. Although I hadnt eaten in over seven hours either, I just couldnt eat mine.
Maybe there was hope for the desert then, I thought. We waited but no dessert menu arrived. Our waitress was very attentive to the larger table beside us but ignored us after our main dish came. We were not offered coffee or dessert. Finally we caught the eye of the bus girl who said there was no dessert menu per se, but our waitress would tell us what was available. We waited. She never came, but the busgirl came over and recited our choices. We ordered tiramisu and caramel cheesecake; both were good. Even after we finished our dessert we were still not offered coffee or tea, nor did we ever see our our waitress again. She came by at the end of dessert, dropped the bill and two candies on the table saying, and I quote: "here you go" without even looking at us.
We were astonished at such indifferent service at a restaurant with such a good reputation. Front-line staff can make or break a business and should be chosen carefully.
I was brought up in a community of first generation Italians from Calabria, Sicilia and Napoli. I ate in their homes and in their restaurants. The food was simple with just a few ingredients, perfectly fresh and at its highest peak, and was magnificent. All of it. I have not been able to match it in Ottawa. Not once. I tried a few in Little Italy some years ago, but although fine, it was not not spectacular. I have been searching this site for highly recommended Italian places,and have been unsuccessful , bit will continue looking and trying. But then, this place was highly recommended, so who can tell? Perhaps this is because the first generation post war Italian families have passed away and their children have adapted the recipes to fit the generic demand.
This meal was terrible. The service was poor, and the only saving grace was the bus girl - who should be promoted by the way, and the dessert. We dine out often and are extremely generous tippers - even when the service is somewhat sub par. But there is no excuse for that level of indifference indifference and we tipped accordingly.

I have yet to try a menu item that wasn’t worth bragging about for days after. It is nearly impossible to settle on one appetizer and one entrée so sharing is definitely a smart strategy to ensure you get the most out of your dining experience. The caesar salad, dressed perfectly with a burst of anchovie flavour (as caesar salad should) is an appropriate way to begin your meal. For something a bit more sophisticated, I would suggest the Insalata Veniciana (mixed greens, tomatoes, goat cheese, red onion and pinenuts) is tangy, creamy and generous in portion size. For a seafood spin, try the muscles (Tigulio in my opinion) with its lemony, flavourful broth. The calamari is also seasoned and fried to perfection with savoury aioli and marinara for dipping. For an easy to eat and delicious shareable, opt for their thinly battered and salty zucchini sticks.

Your entrée choice will depend entirely on which Italian food appeals most to you. Their pizza sits on a thin and chewy crust and is absolutely covered in toppings of your choice (carne carne has meatballs, pepperoni, italian sausage and pancetta, which I also took the liberty of adding onions and green olives to). The pasta choices, which I believe are the true stars of this restaurant, are irresitably flavoured (from creamy, cheesy linguini carbonara to spicy sausage and pepper penne) and can definitely be shared when paired with an appetizer. Anything covered in their signature homemade tomato sauce (such as the chicken parmiagiana or eggplant parm dianna is sure to thrill your palate. My mouth is watering just thinking about my current pasta go to-the Rigatoni Soprano, made with onions, pancetta and spinach in a white wine rosé sauce.

The best tip I can leave you with if you plan on visiting “Porto” as we call it, is to call far in advance. Space is limited and unfortunately for us, word of this outstanding cuisine has spread further than Barrhaven….even take out has an order cap.

Dark is best, and pure is super-best and a square (or three) of the dark pure stuff every day means you’ll live long and prosper. Or at least you’ll live what you’ll live but you’ll live it much happier.

There’s a new — to me — chocolate shop on Wellington West. I popped in to A Thing for Chocolate (such a clever name) for breakfast the other day. Had the bacon and egg made-to-order crepe, which was really very nice, though I’d have preferred it be served with fruit than greens (drizzled with what tasted like bottled balsamic), it being morning and all. But what really turned my crank was the stuff on the end of the spoon I was handed.

“Try this,” the charmer holding the handle said. The first taste was of rich, clean, creamy chocolate. And then the hazelnut hit me and my spirits instantly dropped, only to be lifted again once the purity of flavour sank in.

Generally speaking, I am not a fan of gianduja. Which does, I agree, make me a bit of a freak, but there you go. I like chocolate. I like hazelnuts, I just don’t like them together. Too many cheap gianduja fillings perhaps, with added sugar and emulsifiers and so forth, are to blame, but man oh man, I liked this stuff — really liked this stuff — which is, I believe, a tribute to its quality. It was so fresh, so pure, and so clean.

Chocolatier Omar Fares uses only quality organic hazelnuts and toasts them until they’re golden and fragrant. There’s a bit of cream in there, as well as chocolate and puréed nuts, so don’t forget to keep it in the fridge. Once mixed, the smooth brown goo is jarred with a fetching green rubber ringed lid.

Im usually still waking up by the time I leave the house, so making breakfast is just not ideal -- whether its the that morning or even the previous night. The sun is usually still waking up too.

And thats where A&W comes to the rescue. For a few months working at the Costco location in Merivale, Id go to Tim Hortons for some morning coffee or tea. Some time at the end of summer, some one told me that A&W was open for breakfast. I was so excited! The last time I had breakfast at A&W was over 6 years ago in Kingston. Lucy and I loved their breakfast sandwiches made with hamburger buns. I knew what Id order first.

Heres the breakfast sausage sandwich combo with a hamburger bun instead of an english muffin. The sweet fluffy bun provided a nice contrast to the salty sausage patties. The hash brown that was included was super hot and crisp. They were much better than the soggy thin hash browns at Timmys.

One morning, I ran some errands before I went to work and so I was super early -- almost 2 hours early. So I tried out their classic breakfast and received a tray with my breakfast and a mug of coffee. The tray added something special. It was a nice touch. I got comfortable and enjoyed my classic breakfast while surfing the web on their free wifi.

Ive since learned that their orange pekoe tea is a better option than their coffee.

Heres some bad news though. Earlier this past weekend, I planned to grab some breakfast at A&W before work but their signs were gone. I didnt walk up to the door. It looked closed so I walked across the street for some Timmys.

There is good news! Their voicemail says that theyve closed down their store temporarily from Nov. 11th to about Dec. 9th for renovations. Huzzah! Im eagerly waiting until theyre open for business again.

Since we had the Sprout, when our anniversary rolls around we struggle to figure out what to do to celebrate.  In fact, whatever we did last year....had to be a dud because I cant remember what we did.  At all.  *waits for it to come to her*  Nope...not even two seconds of a memory of the event.  Apparently, my Mister was determined to make this one memorable.  

Weve had a rough year...Ive kept you informed enough that I suppose you can add together moving across the country, a miscarriage, an emergency surgery, my mom having a heart attack, a pelvic surgery/losing an ovary, a brain surgery....another brain surgery and you get the same answer most people do.  They are surprised I still smile.  Lol....but Im not surprised...and I still do.  Plenty!

The first thing my Mister did was hire a loverly girl from church to sit the Sprout, then he went and bought me a brand new dress and cover up (I tried it on before my brothers wedding...it was a dress he REALLY liked on me, but in the end we didnt buy it for the wedding.) and then...he made reservations at a fine dining place.  Beckta Dining and Wine.



 I was really excited to eat here, it was on my "to eat" list after all.  I had taken a look at their menu the day before and couldnt decide what to get, so I made an executive call and went with the 8 course tasting menu.  Why not?  Then Id be trying "a little of everything" right?  Of course right!  When we walked in for our 6:30 reservation it was already humming in there.  I instantly felt way overdressed for the occasion though.  None of the other customers were that dressed up.  Oh well...

When our waiter came to ask us what we would like I ordered the 8 course tasting menu for us.  If one person at the table orders it...everyone has to have it and my Mister was fine with that.  I wondered if the optional cheese course came with it and he told me it was sort of worked into it.  I found out later...there really wasnt much cheese included but, I also discovered with 8 courses I didnt have room for anything else.  But lets get started....and let me apologize now for the lighting in my photos.  It was slightly dim inside....

"Amuse" 
(Mushroom Croquettes)


These little spoons were the PERFECT bite!  A nice mellow mushroom flavor in a fine crispy coating with a smooth garlic aioli and a robust relish.  It was balanced perfectly.  It really got me excited for the rest of the evening!  I assumed that on a Friday night the place was going to be filling up so as soon as I finished my croquette I got up to take what pictures of the inside that I could without disturbing the other customers.

Bench & Table Seating


 Private Dining


By the time I made it back to the table, our first course was served and it looked amazing!

Heirloom Tomato Salad


The heirloom tomatoes were beautifully meaty and fresh, the grilled halloumi was nice and salty and just set off the sweetness of the tomatoes so well, and add to that the tomatillo gazpacho, yellow pepper puree and the creamy toasted pine nuts and you have a real winner!

Foie Gras Mousse

 
I wont lie to you...I wasnt a fan of the foie gras mousse.  I love rich foods as much as the next woman, but I could barely handle this.  I had to dip my fork in the sweet Peking Glaze and the salty, sour purslane and a bit of the wonton cracker to be able to make it "okay" to chew.  I always try things on their own first, it was a huge mistake with the foie gras.  My Mister and I both thought it felt like we took a giant bite of a stick of butter.  

I needed something to cleanse my palate...  Lucky for me, there was a guy walking around handing out fabulous bread from True Loaf Bakery in Ottawa.  That concept is very important to me...staying local with your offerings and ingredients as much as possible.  Way to go Beckta!

Date & Fennel Bread


When we were in Manhattan back in 2007, we lunched in Central Park with some food we picked up from Dean & Deluca.  I will never forget my sandwich, ham & swiss with stone ground mustard on fennel and golden raisin bread slices.  It was a thing of beauty.  The bread I chose to try at Beckta was True Loafs Date and Fennel bread.  It far surpassed my expectations...but if I kept eating bread I wasnt going to be able to finish my other 6 courses still to come!

Oysters 3 Ways

    
My Mister was less than excited when this landed in front of him.  He has trouble swallowing more than one vitamin at a time.  So *giggles* I KNEW as soon as I saw the terror in his eyes, the he was dreading trying to swallow the oysters whole.  He asked the waiter if he should chew them or not, he kind of left it up to my Mister.  But for me it was down the hatch with the first one.  The very top oyster on the plate was raw and simply dressed with horseradish and it was pretty good.  The middle oyster was lightly crusted, perfectly fried and served on a bed of sauteed, sweet wakame.  That was my favorite of the plate... The third oyster was warm and enveloped in a savory, lightly sweet cider soubise sauce.  It was my runner up...  I LOVED this course!!


Corn Croquettes


These little babies were more complex than they looked.  On the inside of the, again...perfectly, but lightly crisp outside, we were favored with a mixture of peaches, grits and corn.  It was so interesting and it totally worked!  The yellow sauce up at the top of the plate was a bourbon curd, the sauce under the croquettes was a smoked creme fraiche and sprinkled over the top were some pickled watermelon rind.  With a dab of each sauce and a piece of the rind in each bite these little babies were pretty good.  By themselves, they were a bit rich.  The croquettes definitely needed those sauces and garnish.

Pork Belly

  
This was one of my Misters favorite courses.  We both love bacon, but this was 50 times better!  It was lightly salted on top which actually brought the pleasant sweetness out of the meat.  The zucchini escabeche was wonderful and the eggplant puree was smooth in flavor.  I ended up leaving most of my fava beans on the plate though.  They just arent my cup of tea...

I was starting to sense that I was nearing the "full mark" on my tummy.  It was SUCH luck that these courses were spaced out so well or Id have been toast after course number 3!  But just then...our waiter brought us our new set of silverware.  There was a steak knife!  I was so excited!  MEAT...lots of it!


Duck Magret


This looked SO wonderful!  I almost didnt want to touch it, but...then again I LOVE a beautifully cooked duck breast.  I leaned in to inhale...it smelled like Heaven on a plate.  The duck breast was PERFECTLY cooked.  It is hard to tell from the lighting, but it was superbly prepared.  It was sliced and fanned over a bed of miso sweet potato gratin and dressed with shiitake mushrooms and a black garlic demi glace to DIE for!  The duck was so succulent and tender...  The sesame beans and pickled ginger tempura were just the icing on the cake.  There were so many complex layers of flavor built into this dish...I would go again JUST for that entree.  Everything was perfectly delightful on that plate.

When they took away my plate I felt like I was going to burst.  A couple times my Mister and I had tried to recap and count...what course are we on???  We werent sure we could make it through the rest of the courses.  2 more...  Oofdah!


Sage Fried Cornbread


This baby came out of the kitchen HOT!  The little skillet was majorejo raclette just out of the oven and topped table side with oloroso sherry.  I waited a couple minutes for the sizzle to die down in the skillet, then I forked some of the cheese out of the skillet, added some of the sage cornbread and I dabbed it in the lingonberry gastrique.  All together it was pretty good, then I explored each component on its own.  I ended up eating the rest of my course without the lingonberry gastrigue.  It was simply TOO bitter for me, even with all of the sweetness from the sherry and the fried cornbread.

Dessert Trio

   
It was so sweet of them to write "Happy Anniversary" on our plates with chocolate.  After the waiter explained each dessert I started from left to right...  The first one was a shaved ice Mai Tai with a candied slice of lemon.  The lemon was pretty interesting but I couldnt handle the bitterness of the alcohol.  I went for the ice cream in the middle under the chocolate biscotti...  Blech!  All I tasted was coffee.  I dont drink it...when it is in chocolate cake recipes or the like, I leave it out.  I cautiously stuck my spoon into the last cup and tried the shaved ice that was margarita flavored.  There was a little coconut dacquoise on top.  It was the texture of a meringue but didnt have much of a detectable coconut flavor.  *shrug*  So I went for what I was leaving for last, because it looked like a "sure thing"....  The chocolate biscotti.  It was the best thing on the plate.  I dredged my biscotti in a bit of the melted chocolate and just reveled in it.  

It was our 8th and final course and I was seriously bursting at the seams internally.  My Mister asked for the check so I started getting my camera and notes ready to go...  Thats when the waiter brought our whole menu typed out with "Happy Anniversary" written across the top.  Wow!  Such a helpful staff!  I spent some time making notes and trying to remember everything they told us so I didnt forget a single element on each course...so this relieved me a bit.  I knew I wouldnt get anything wrong now.

Then something else came out of the kitchen...a special cherry to the top of our already fabulous evening...

Petit Fours

  
 The two little cookies had peaches and what tasted like oats, they were pretty good.   But the best part for me was the little bite of bar in the back.  A seriously chocolatey, rich bottom that had all the feeling of a brownie but light enough you could still call it "cake" and it was topped with a moist layer of coconut cake.  I really loved that little bite of cake.  It was a wonderful ending to a spectacular evening of food.

Id be lying if I said the best part of the evening was the food, though I cant recommend Becktas enough for all your fine dining special occasions...  They really went out of their way to make the evening special with their service and the food was every bit of the description of "fine".  For me, the highlight of my evening was my company.  My Mister and I dont get out much, let alone without being totally preoccupied about what the Sprout is up to.  We spent most of our time talking about our relationship, traveling, food and his job; the first three of those are some of my favorite things to talk about, his job....not so much.  

We didnt spend a lot of time talking about all of the unbelievably excruciating challenges weve been through in the past year, or how we didnt deal as well with some of those challenges as we did with others.  We didnt need to...we were just relieved to be sitting with each other, to be alive and to still be in love.  ', 0, 0, 5.0);

INSERT INTO rating (location_id, rater_id, date_written, price, food, ambiance, service,  _comments,  found_helpful, wasnt_helpful, avg_rating) VALUES (6, 11, '2013-10-23', 4, 2, 4, 4, 'When I assess the quality of a restaurant, i generally take into account a multitude of factors. For the most part, restaurants focus on food, and really, that is all that matters to me. After all, without good food, there really is very little reason to visit a restaurant. There are some establishments that focus more on wine. The menu is little more than an excuse to showcase a Wine Spectator worthy list. To me, wine without great food is a waste. However, it is a rare place when you have a restaurant that seamlessly marries food and wine – to the point where it’s hard to imagine having one without the other. Beckta is one of those places.

Beckta first hit the Canadian consciousness when showcased on an episode of Food Network’s “Opening Soon”. The brainchild of sommelier Stephen Beckta, it’s the story of the homecoming of a local boy “done good”. A sommelier who worked in NYC at Cafe Boulud and Eleven Madison Park, returns home to up the local scene. With his extensive experience in building world class wine lists, he has not only put together a fantastic list of eclectic, quality wines, but has dedicated a large portion of his list to local, Canadian producers. A diverse selection of Ontario wines that showcases some of the best our country has to offer.

But as i mentioned, for me, it’s all about the food. The original menu was a Stephen Vardy creation, a young, up and coming chef when he first started at Beckta who has since moved onto a variety of different projects.  Michael Moffat, his sous-chef, took over without any appreciable drop in quality. In fact, in my opinion, his experience over the relatively inexperienced Vardy has strengthened the marriage of wine and food.

The food emphasizes seasonal, local, organic, and sustainable, combined with top quality producers from around the country. While everything is available a la carte, the only way to dine at Beckta is through the chef’s tasting menu ($79), complete with wine pairings($35), and the optional cheese course ($15). The tasting menu is its own inspiration – and does not reuse standard menu items like so many places do these days. Each wine selection is carefully chosen, and when i did find some small fault with a pairing (mostly a matter of personal taste), a new pairing was selected that better fit my palate.

With all the publicity and press Beckta has gotten, I think deep down, I spent a lot of time looking for something not to like about the experience. I couldn’t fine one thing wrong. The atmosphere was classy, hip, yet comfortable. The service was impeccable – both food service, and wine service. In fact, similar to Chambar in Vancouver, this was some of the best service I’ve had in a very long time. Friendly, approachable, yet professional. Efficient without the snottiness.

As for the food? It did a great job of highlighting a lot of the strengths of Canadian food quality. From Alberta beef, to Nunavut char, to Quebec duck, to Nova Scotia scallops, everything was very well executed – perfectly seasoned, packed full of flavour, clear in purpose, creative, and most importantly, the dishes just worked.

When it’s all about the food, I find it’s about finding the right balance of flavours. Along with amuse and palate cleanser, I was dazzled with an array of flavours. Perhaps the my favorite course of the evening was a torchon of foie gras, along with a parmesan cornetto filled with epoisse and sweetbreads. While some might consider this to be too rich, cut with the acidity of the wine, the interplay of sweetbreads, with warmed epoisse and parmesan was perfect.


My last general concern when sizing up a restaurant is about portion size. I am occasionally a bit of a glutton. Tasting menus, in my experience, often leave me fairly dissatisfied. I need only point out experiences at Manresa (with a trip to In N Out afterwards) as an example where the portion size was disproportionate to the cost. With Beckta, there is no need to be concerned about the portion sizes. Everything comes in a good sized portion, allowing you time to savour and enjoy the flavours, without overwhelming you. After this meal, I was stuffed. And yet i still found some room to sample their extensive cheese course – filled with a great selection of high quality, small production cheeses. I did mention something about gluttony….

I generally try to bring a balanced approach to my reviews – after all, there is usually a balance of both positive and negative experiences when dining at any restaurant. However, try as I might, I really have nothing negative to say about Beckta at all. Great atmosphere, great food, great wine, great service. For me, this is *the* place to dine when in the Ottawa region.  With a new restaurant opening in the next year, here’s hoping that they are able to maintain the same lofty standards they’ve already set. After all, they have a tough act to follow.', 0, 0, 3.3);

The people have spoken. The Elgin Street taco hangout prevailed in the Citizen’s online poll to determine Ottawa’s top venue for tortilla-based treats.

But what I can add to the El Camino conversation is that chef Matthew Carmichael’s small plates are no less enjoyable than his tacos. Frankly, if you’ve followed Carmichael’s commendable and refined cooking over the years at Restaurant E18hteen, Social, and most recently Sidedoor Contemporary Kitchen and Bar, the exceptional small plates should have been expected.

Indeed, what Carmichael did at Sidedoor, from its early 2011 opening until he left it less than year later, was a more expansive version of the stripped-down but equally Asian-inspired fare served at El Camino.

Carmichael’s new joint, which opened in late May, is almost as casual as anything else on Elgin Street. Past the takeout window, El Camino seats 50 or so people — no reservations, first come, first served — in a cavelike concrete space, darkened but for some halogen lighting. It’s the opposite of plush, all hard benches and bar stools, and the sounds of raw, twanging music and nearby chatter can drown out a server’s explanations of dishes. And that’s not to mention the clanging of the retro, hipster-friendly pinball machine.

Given El Camino’s one-page menu with 15 edibles on one side, and many more beverages on the other, it might be more correct to think of the place as a bar that serves enticing food. Indeed, after one of its dozen types of tequila, or a cocktail flavoured with agave nectar, or one of six local craft beers on tap, plus a round of Carmichael’s shareable plates, you might even ponder if El Camino serves the best izakaya (Japanese pub) food in Ottawa — even if it isn’t an izakaya.

A few weeks ago on a Sunday night when El Camino was packed, we ordered most of its small plates and all of the tacos. The plates arrived before any tacos and all but one set the bar high.

The most expensive dishes, Tuna Tartare with Taro Chips ($18) and Scallop Crudo with XO Sauce ($16), were worthwhile, raw-bar splurges, showing off seafood that was fine, fresh and brightly seasoned. As good as both were, the scallops plate was the knockout, with mollusk meat dressed to best advantage in a puddle that blended acidity and funk. (XO sauce, that Hong Kong condiment, is made not with cognac but with, among other ingredients, dried shrimp and scallops. So, give Carmichael credit for flavouring raw scallops with dried scallops.)

El Camino’s Shrimp Dumplings ($8) put many a ravioli or dim sum dumpling to shame. The roughly chopped shrimp bits inside were firm and sweet, and the apparently boiled-then-fried skins were a tasty and textural treat unto themselves.

Shrimp also flourished in the funky deep-fried Crispy Prawn Betel Leaf ($8), a Japan-meets-Vietnam preparation, I think, that combined light, grease-free crunchiness, intriguing herbaceousness and a moist, shrimpy centre.

Funkiest of all was the Chicken Thigh with Fish Sauce and Chili ($9), which our server warned was overly fish-sauced and pungent for some. The dish’s big flavours went down pretty easy for us, with the moist, crunchy-skinned meat standing up to its fiery accents.

Among the plates, the closest thing to a letdown was the Salt and Pepper Squid ($9), which was surprisingly pedestrian. Chinese-restaurant cooks push the spicing more aggressively than Carmichael did, it seemed.

The later-to-the-party tacos ($4 each), as of today Ottawa’s favourites, were unsurprisingly good. Beef, lamb and pork tacos were all parcels of distinctly flavoured, slow-cooked goodness. The crispy fish taco was better still and best, but perhaps not for everyone, was the ox tongue taco, tender, charred and offal-icious.

After the plates and tacos, the five of us were sated as far as savories went, but not stuffed. We wanted dessert — but El Camino couldn’t help us. The server said that some sweet closer had been on the menu but it had been removed, and that we should go to Pure Gelato, a block north on Elgin, for ice cream. And so, we did.

But even without any desserts, El Camino proved to be a joint worth further visits for boisterous bites in a raucous setting. Come to think of it, even without its tacos, the same would be true.', 0, 0, 4.3);

A better synonym for umami might be “meatiness” or “savouriness.” Whatever you call it, many dishes at Wall’s recently opened restaurant Supply and Demand brim with it.

There’s the anchovy juice and bacon elevating the brussels sprouts. There’s the caper vinaigrette, scattering of bacon, and pile of grated manchego cheese that make the kale salad mouth-watering. There’s the truffle oil anointing Wall’s signature tuna crudo. All provide the umami pop of natural glutamates, something which MSG delivers more artificially.

If that’s too analytical for you, simply rest assured that many dishes on Wall’s compact menu are almost addictively delicious, and others, while they wow a little less, are still satisfying.

Given the level of Supply and Demand’s food, its convivial atmosphere, and smart, knowledgeable service, I’ll put it this way — come for the umami, stay for everything else.

Wall and his wife Jennifer opened this bustling 60-seater on Wellington Street West about a month ago. Both are not yet 30. But for the last seven years, the young chef has starred at some of Ottawa’s leading restaurants, having cooked at Beckta Dining & Wine and run the kitchens of the Whalesbone Oyster House, Town and Luxe Bistro.

Now on his own, Wall is advancing a smart, timely concept that should resonate with contemporary tastes. Supply and Demand’s one-page menu is tweaked daily, but it always gives seafood, in particular in sophisticated raw preparations, pride of place. It spotlights small plates and shareable vegetable dishes. There are several mains and pasta dishes for those who want a substantial meal on a plate.

On first glance, we were a bit befuddled by this range. But after our server doled out all the information we needed about portion sizes and the heaviness of dishes, we ordered with confidence. Some of us went crazy on smaller plates, while others ate more traditionally with an appetizer and main course.

That bit of orientation was the first sign of Supply and Demand’s thoughtful service, overseen by Jennifer Wall, a former server at Town whose middle name might be “unpretentious-hospitality.”

Overall, we favoured some knockout, smaller, sub-$20 offerings just a bit more than the larger, over-$24 plates, although this really is the difference between “wow” and “quite good.”

We were immediately impressed by the complimentary, pillowy Parker House rolls served with some tricked-out butter, such that the usual on-the-house bread service was a fluffy, salty, sweet kick.

A tip: Ask for extra bread, which you will use to sop up the top-notch sauces, oils and the like on Wall’s dishes. That’s more polite than licking the plate.

After the rolls came a run of excellent dishes. The truffled, lemon-kissed tuna crudo ($14) featured luscious slabs of raw fish, with puffed wild rice adding crunch and young cilantro bringing mellow herbaceousness. Duck tartare ($14) was a mound of finely chopped, impeccably fresh duck breast, boosted by capers and mustard as beef tartare usually is, and then jazzed with the crunch of corn nuts. It was a huge hit at our table.

The bowl of kale salad ($7), magically devoid of bitterness and filled with concentrated flavour, riffed on caesar salad. The brussels sprouts ($5) were irresistible, thanks to the deeply flavoured “anchovy juice” sauce that should cure anyone of an anti-anchovy ­bias.

More simple was the plate of roasted and pickled beets served with goat cheese. While some restaurants go over the top with their beets-plus-chèvre salads, Wall to his credit has simplified the familiar flavour combo to let its essentials shine.

The pickled element, by the way, is one of Wall’s many vinegar-enhanced touches — see also his pickle juices with oysters, his pickled beef tongue, his pickled-then-fried cauliflower, his pickled ­onions that adorn a lobster and bacon tart. While I didn’t try these dishes, I can say that I approve of Wall’s embrace of tart acidity to add brightness, complexity and balance to his food.

More subtle and rarefied was the razor clam crudo ($13). Not an assertive crowd-pleaser like the tuna crudo, it featured a small amount of the delicate, slightly sweet clam meat dressed with fennel pollen, bits of pickled chilies, scallions and olive oil.

The tuna and prosciutto meatballs ($14) struck me as a bit dry, but still flavourful. They were nestled in a fine concoction of cranberry beans and soffrito — oh right, the concentrated tomatoes in the soffrito were rich in umami.

Tasty gemelli pasta came in a big helping, sauced with rosemary-tinged, shredded duck thighs and Fleurs Des Monts sheep’s milk cheese ($24). The person who ordered it took home at least half of the serving for his next day’s enjoyment.

We agreed on the rankings of the restaurant’s three mains.

Good was the sautéed white trout ($23) — while the fish by itself wasn’t a home run, the cured lemon, shaved fennel and apple slaw that adorned it were welcome additions.

Better was the Berkshire pork duo ($25), which offered a stubby cotechino sausage and a square of melting, sweetly glazed pork belly, along with creamy polenta made more sumptuous by the release of a coddled egg’s yolk.

The second signal of good service came with this dish. Given carte blanche, the server confidently paired with it a glass of Moroccan Brown Ale from Toronto’s Spearhead Brewery. On the whole, the compact beer and wine lists are populated with savvy, reasonably priced selections.

The best main was Wall’s butter-poached lobster, worth its $38 price tag thanks to the succulence of the shellfish and the swoon-inducing sauce.

One benefit of a small-plates dinner is that there’s usually room for dessert. We tried all three. Good was the bread pudding topped with cinnamon ice cream and sitting in a bourbon sauce ($6). Significantly better was the lemon pound cake, sponge toffee and Earl Grey cream in a jar ($8). Best by a nose was the big-enough-for-two, stewed-cherry-enhanced chocolate brownie with a big smear of salted peanut butter ($10).

With that dessert came the third example of thoughtful service. For a diner allergic to peanuts, the kitchen not only did away with the off-limits garnish, but it also substituted a good crème anglaise.

I’ve been food-centric in my review of Supply and Demand simply because Wall’s laudable fare calls for it. But a few words about the eatery’s ambience and atmosphere are in order. It’s a retro space with personality, evoking associations of brasseries and bistros with its tufted banquettes, Bentwood chairs and long bar. You notice touches like the sea horse wallpaper, the white, hexagon-tiled floor and the cosy chef’s bar, and think that the place departs nicely from the more common dark-wood, ductwork-overhead look that has become a cliché.

I have one warning. The place can quickly get very loud with the hubbub of happy diners and drinkers. If you don’t want to strain your hearing during conversations, go early.

But do go. The Walls supply exceptional, reasonably priced food in an appealing setting, and I only hope that they can keep up with the demand that’s sure to come.', 0, 0, 3.7);

The only choice offered with the steak was french fries, so the server offered me some leftover quinoa. It was glued together with barbeque sauce and presented in the shape of the bowl it was mixed in. The steak was mediocre, and smothered in salt. The salad looked pretty but it was lackluster.

And while I will give the food a good review, the service made us a little weary.
We dined at Botaurus this evening and everything started out well. Drinks arrived quickly as did the appetizers. However, the main course is where things began to go downhill. My husband saw one of the servers head to our table with our entrees however our server stopped him and had the plates returned to the kitchen. We assumed the plates being served were not the correct order. After another 5 minutes, our plates arrived. Everything looked great until we realized it wasnt exactly what we ordered.
Husband ordered 10oz with wine / shallot sauce and mushrooms. He got, 6oz with bernaise and no mushrooms. My order was with wine / shallot sauce and mushrooms. I got the correct steak, but without the mushrooms. We were not going to say anything other than ask for the mushrooms to be brought over separately. But then decided, for the price we are paying, we should receive what we ordered, so called the waiter over. As we began to explain, he knew right away what the issue was and quickly collected the plates to rectify the issue.
NOTE***: we had both asked and received fresh pepper on each of our dishes. When my plate was taken, I had my dirty cutlery on the plate.
The waiter left (we were seated near the kitchen) and he disappeared around into the kitchen. About 20 seconds later he came out with 2 plates and delivered them to the table across from us. THESE WERE THE SAME TWO PLATES he just took from our table. We were stunned and froze as we did not know what to do at this point. The couple who received our plates started right into the food at which point there was no return from this fiasco. What do you do?? The dirty cutlery was removed form the plates and the plates given to the original owners!! I panicked. I should have said something. I just prayed through the meal that neither of the individuals had any pepper allergies!
Another 10 minutes passed and we still had not received our meals (the correct ones). We finally flagged down our server and were told it would be another 5 to 10 minutes. 15 minutes passed and still no plates arrived. We flagged him down again and were told it would be any moment now. Within 5 minutes from that point the food arrived. We did eat our meals, but were unable to finish. A mix of being disturbed by what happened, guilt of not flying out of my seat to advise the other table and the progressively poor service. We collected our bill, gave a very poor tip (which the server was not happy with) and fled.
Upon our departure, I requested to speak with the manager, who was not on the premises at the time. Was told he had to leave to get lemons?? I took his name and number. Tried to contact him again about half an hour after we left, but he was too busy and would call back. Unfortunately, we have not heard back from the manager.
It is unfortunate what occurred and I should have done a few things differently and still feel horrible for seeing what I saw and not saying anything. But from a health and safety perspective, those plates should have been tossed!!! From a client service perspective, the impacted tables should have been compensated (both the other couples table and ours). Unfortunately, the server handled this situation poorly and I hope this would never happen again. ', 0, 0, 2.7);

Just across the Champlain Bridge from Ottawa, lies a historic little gem once part of cottage county, now annexed by Gatineau.  But while the merge of municipalities may be complete,  it still remains a distinct local flavour and, for us, it’s home.   When we heard last summer that local entrepreneur and chef Daniel Lalonde, principal in our favorite local Italian restaurant (Ambrosia), was signed on to be part owner and executive chef at Le Bostaurus we held our breath for the massive renovation project to the heritage building (and former strip joint) to be complete.
Our first excursion shortly after they opened, was fast and disappointing.  One look at a menu that read ‘beef, beef, and more beef’ and a roll of the eyes holier-than-thou waiter who actually snorted and walked away with a nearly empty dining room behind him, make it easy to politely walk away and take our money elsewhere.  It wasn’t that we didn’t expect beef, it was that we expected something more than just beef (and a measure of courtesy wouldn’t have hurt a bit).    I turned to the chef in my life and said flatly “they have opening-itus, let’s give them a few months.”
Opening-itus:  the time period between ‘don’t bug me I’m texting my boyfriend’ and ‘we’re professionals here to serve you’ that effects seven out of every ten restaurants.
Some recover quickly and hire well, going on to be killer cafés, bistros and steak houses – some do not.   I am a big believer in second chances, and while the service still suffers a few pit falls now and again, Le Bostaurus bounced back with a broader menu and a loyal local following, that now includes us.
That snotty waiter is gone, the all beef menu likewise; quickly replaced by a selection of red & white meats and seafood specials.  Le Bostaurus has now become our go-to pub when it’s just the two of us and our new white linen tablecloth celebration dining space when it’s a group of us.   High, open-beam ceilings tell a tale of the past while gleaming modern lighting, straight backed chairs and a modern approach to plating have a firm root in the twenty-first century.
On most nights if you’re in the pub you can order from the dining room menu and even mix and match with an appetizer from one menu and an entree from the other.  In the dining room even has a savvy, well thought out kids menu that the four year old approves of.  I might recommend the American Burger ($13.95), for the burger aficionados out there.   Juicy and tasty with just the right mount of fat to make it moist and char on the grill.   That certified Angus makes for a great burger, and it rides along side some truly wicked fries.
On the beefy side, choose from the high end with filet mignon ($38), rib eye ($38) or striploin ($39) and at the low end the  flank ($24) and flatiron ($23) steaks all well marbled and precisely prepared.   Choose your starch, choose your sauce (cognac green peppercorn, red wine shallot or bearnaise), veg of the day at the side.  Pretty standard steak house stuff.  The flatiron is good, likewise for the striploin, the lamb chops are particularly well executed and the bearnaise is exceptional.  We’ve yet to have a piece of meat at Bostaurus that wasn’t handled with respect.
Le Bostaus, American Burger - Food Gypsy
If you have a great product, my philosophy is: don’t mess with it.  That’s why the mark of a truly great steak is not in how the chef seasons and cooks it, but rather in how the chef seasons and prepares it raw, chopped and served as a tasty Steak Tartare ($13).  Why cook it when it’s this delicate?  Why expose flesh to flame when it can be tossed with assorted savory bits from the pantry:  capers, shallots, Dijon, parsley, Worcestershire and olive oil, a hint of gerkin, a single egg yoke.
The chef in my life (Benoit Gelinotte) is making a systematic survey of tartare on menus across the National Capitol Region. (Something I hope he’ll expound upon in his own words one day… God help us all.)  His favourite remains a reconstructed version at Navarra on Ottawa’s Byward Market, but the Tartare at Le Bostaurus  is done exceptionally well (top photo).   The plating is playful and fun and the seasoning is spot on, allowing the tone and texture of the beef to shine through.
I’ll be honest, I’m not a raw meat kinda’ gal, but through our time together I’ve a developed a tolerance for textures I once found repulsive.  I’m not sure that’s a good thing, but that new found  tolerance threshold allows for small discoveries like this tartare coupled with the fresh, peppery arugula salad that accompanies it.  The balance of salt and acidity, smooth and crunchy.   One perfect bite.
But you know what would be nice?  If you would be so kind as to grill it and bring it on a sassy little bun, and put some crispy bacon, lettuce and tomato, maybe a condiment or two on it and we’ll call it a day.

The hostesses were very patient with the families. It was a very welcoming environment on a cold Sunday evening during Winterlude.

It is located in the heart of Ottawa in the shadow of the Chateau Laurier Hotel and has some nice architectural features.  It has a nice outdoor patio in the summer.

My son Mark and I decided to begin with appetizers.  He had the mushroom soup which was outstanding and generous.

We shared two portions of phyllo shrimp - we always choose these when we are in any Milestones.  They are mouth watering and served with Thai chili sauce for dipping.

For our mains Mark ordered the Cajun Shrimp Diane with Louisiana style shrimp, with Reggiano cheese, scallions and roasted mushrooms in a lightly spiced garlic cream sauce, served with bok choy, roasted grape tomatoes and he chose the garlic mash instead of the standard jasmine rice.  He always enjoys this dish.

I decided to try the portobello mushroom chicken with two chicken breasts and sliced portobellos sauteed in olive oil with fresh basil, roasted garlic and reduced Reggiano cream over garlic mashed potatoes.  It was accompanied by carrots and green beans.  It was delicious.

I went there for lunch with a bunch of colleagues between two meetings, and hesitated for some time as I studied the menu. Despite the “a little of everything for everyone” approach, I was really undecided. Salads, Sandwiches, Burgers and Wraps, Pasta, Asian-style, Steaks, Chicken and Seafood. They even have a Gluten-Free selection, which I assume is appreciated by those on a Gluten-Free diet.
The food is generally good, if overpriced. Which perhaps leads to the aforementioned hesitation.

After a few minutes, I settled on Milestone’s version of comfort food, from their menu’s urban classics section: The Kobe Style Classic Meatloaf. Apparently, meatloaf were once very popular with the urban scene.

The service was prompt and efficient (if familiar), and my meatloaf arrived promptly.

The meatloaf comes topped with lightly fried onion strings and is served over their garlic mashed potatoes, with a shiitake mushroom au jus and seasoned vegetables, in this case carrots and green beans. Fresh parsley was used as a garnish.', 0, 0, 3.3);

There was a line when we (4 of us) got there around 2:45 PM - not a huge line though. The menu showed that 2 items were sold out.

I ll try something else.
I picked the chicken caesar, my 2 kids the angus sandwich. They let us know there was only one half of an angus left. One of my kids then chose the chicken caesar while the cashier was going to go "check if they still actually had the angus left." Nope, no angus so he chose the grilled cheese.
We place the rest of our order, then paid, and got seated. A few minutes later, a waitress comes and tells us there is no chicken caesar left. Only 3 sandwiches are left, out of about 8-10. They ask us if we want to substitute for the grilled cheese. Ummm no. I just paid over $12 for chicken caesar, I m not accepting an $8 grilled cheese.

Ive tried the chicken caesar, the classic ham, and tuna melt and deep fried pickle sandwiches and they were all very delicious. However, its worth noting that the chicken caesar sandwich is rather large, and isnt half as good if you save some for later, because of the chicken fat in there. Also, the pickle sandwich is pretty darned awkward to eat, but both are worth it; just dot buy the pickle sandwich if you intend to eat in front of your coworkers. The ordering system needs improvement. Youre supposed to wait for someone to call your name and bring you your order, but when its really crowded, as it often is, you cant hear them call your name.

There were some guffaws, apparently. And some don’t believe he actually said that, but the story’s better than the facts, so it lives on.
To be confused with one of Kevin Mathieson’s Berliners would be no great insult, it seems to me.
Mathieson is the king of jelly doughnuts in this town. Berliners, they are called. Or Pfannkuchen, a North German pastry made from sweet dough, sprinkled with shiny sugar, and typically filled in with jam.
And this seasonal one, filled in with pumpkin cream is a true treat, because yes, the pastry itself is fresh and light and not too sweet, but it’s the quality of the pastry cream that’s so fantastic. With the added bonus that he hasn’t gone crazy with the nutmeg. Nothing ruins pumpkin more than an indelicate hand with the nutmeg grater.
I am a huge fan of Art-is-in Bakery for the obvious reasons everyone who loves great bread is also a fan. Other great sources for bread have sprouted in this city, and more and more restaurants are baking their own and doing a dandy job, but I’m  old enough to remember when Ottawa restaurants’ bread baskets were pretty grim, and Kevin Mathieson and Stephanie Monnin changed all that. And for this Constant Eater-Outer, I am forever grateful.
I hope the season for folding pumpkin into crème patissière isn’t over… If I show up next week and see mincemeat Berliners I’m taking down this post.', 0, 0, 2.7);

I loved the catfish po boy, but I didnt order a side so the sandwich arrived all alone on a plate. There is something sad and unsatisfying about a lone sandwich on a stark white plate. For a place that puts so much effort into details, this total lack of presentation was surprising. Even a couple slices of cucumber would go a long way toward not making the customer feel like he/she was being punished for not adding a $5 side to a $13 sandwich.
